# üéØ FMU Gateway - Current Status & Next Steps

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Progress:** 85% Complete (1 issue to fix before launch)

---

## ‚úÖ What's Working Perfectly

1. **External Access** - ‚úÖ Gateway reachable at https://fmu-gateway-long-pine-7571.fly.dev
2. **Stripe Integration** - ‚úÖ Checkout sessions creating successfully
3. **HTTP 402 Flow** - ‚úÖ Payment-required responses working
4. **Webhook Configuration** - ‚úÖ Secret configured
5. **All Code** - ‚úÖ Complete and tested locally
6. **Deployment** - ‚úÖ Running on Fly.io

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issue Discovered: Database Persistence

### The Problem
- You have **2 machines** running
- **NO persistent volume** attached
- Each machine has its own local SQLite database
- API keys created on Machine 1 won't work on Machine 2

### Impact
- API keys may appear "invalid" randomly
- Payment tokens may not be found
- Testing is unreliable

### Solution (Choose One)

#### Option 1: Add Persistent Volume (Recommended for Production)
```bash
# Create volume
fly volumes create fmu_data --size 1 -a fmu-gateway-long-pine-7571

# Update fly.toml (add after [[vm]] section):
[[mounts]]
  source = "fmu_data"
  destination = "/data"

# Redeploy
fly deploy --remote-only -a fmu-gateway-long-pine-7571
```

**Pros:** Database persists across restarts, shared between machines  
**Cons:** Adds ~$0.15/month cost, requires redeployment

#### Option 2: Scale to 1 Machine (Quick Fix)
```bash
fly scale count 1 -a fmu-gateway-long-pine-7571
```

**Pros:** Immediate fix, no config changes, works for low traffic  
**Cons:** No redundancy, single point of failure

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (15 Minutes)

1. **Fix Database Issue**
   ```bash
   # Quick fix for now:
   fly scale count 1 -a fmu-gateway-long-pine-7571
   ```

2. **Manual Test**
   - Follow steps in `MANUAL_TEST_STEPS.md`
   - Create key, request simulation, pay, execute
   - Verify complete flow works

3. **Verify Webhook**
   - Check Stripe dashboard for webhook delivery
   - Confirm token generation works

### Before Launch (1-2 Hours)

4. **Add Persistent Volume**
   - Follow Option 1 above
   - Ensures database reliability

5. **Switch to Live Mode**
   ```bash
   fly secrets set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_YOUR_KEY -a fmu-gateway-long-pine-7571
   ```
   - Update webhook in Stripe to live endpoint
   - Test with real card

6. **Deploy Landing Page**
   - Use GitHub Pages or Carrd
   - Link to API docs
   - Include pricing and "Try Now" button

7. **Launch Announcements**
   - LinkedIn post (template in `docs/launch_posts.md`)
   - Reddit r/controltheory, r/simulations
   - Track first paying customer!
