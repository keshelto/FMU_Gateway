# Soft Launch Copy â€” FMU Gateway Â£1 Simulation API

## LinkedIn Post
ðŸš€ **FMU Gateway is live!**

Upload any FMI 2.0/3.0 FMU and run it in the cloud for just **Â£1 per simulation**.

âœ… Hosted `/simulate` API
âœ… Stripe Checkout with instant tokens
âœ… Deterministic runs powered by FMPy

How it works:
1. Hit `/simulate` â†’ receive a Stripe Checkout link (HTTP 402).
2. Pay with card/Apple Pay/Google Pay.
3. Call `/payments/checkout/{session_id}` to grab your token.
4. Re-run `/simulate` with the token and collect the results.

Perfect for engineering teams that need to demo or validate FMUs without standing up infrastructure.

Title: Run FMI FMUs in the cloud for Â£1 per simulation (Stripe checkout)

Body:
Hey folks â€” we just shipped **FMU Gateway**, a hosted API for executing FMI 2.0/3.0 FMUs. No servers to manage, just upload + run.

* Pay-per-simulation via Stripe Checkout (defaults to Â£1)
* HTTPS `/simulate` endpoint with deterministic outputs
* Token-based flow so you can charge clients before delivering results

Flow:
1. Call `/simulate` â†’ it responds 402 with a `checkout_url`.
2. Pay (card / Apple Pay / Google Pay).
3. Fetch a short-lived token from `/payments/checkout/{session_id}`.
4. Call `/simulate` again with the token to run the model and grab KPIs/history.

Would love feedback from anyone running Modelica/Simulink FMUs or building engineering tools! ðŸ’¬
