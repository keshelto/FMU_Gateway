# Design Documentation Template

## Requirements
This section shall capture all the physical requirements to ensure part(s) function properly. As these are to be created early in the design process, general requirements are acceptable. As the project matures, the requirements will be refined so that the final released component and the final requirements are aligned.

Some types of requirements to cover:
- Specific running conditions
- Mass targets
- Mileages/durability targets
- NVH
- Printing features
- Material compatibility/corrosion
- Technical specifications (size, weight, materials, etc.)
- Performance criteria (power output, efficiency, etc.)
- Environmental and regulatory considerations
- Cost and time constraints
- Standard visual representation of the complete system (e.g., GT-Power, MATLAB
  Simulink, TensorFlow/Lambda block diagrams, or an equivalent polished
  schematic) to communicate structure and signal flow

| Num | Requirement | Achieved |
| --- | ----------- | -------- |
| 1   |             |          |
| 2   |             |          |
| 3   |             |          |
| 4   |             |          |
| 5   |             |          |
| 6   |             |          |
| 7   |             |          |
| 8   |             |          |
| 9   |             |          |
| 10  |             |          |

## Prove Out
This section lists all the actions required to approve a part to be applied to production. It shall be comprehensive enough that if all actions are complete, we are confident that the part will meet all performance and durability targets when installed on the production car. Completing this list at the beginning of the process helps to identify any tooling or long lead items needed to ensure that the tests that need to get done can get done in a timely manner. Common tasks that are to be completed for every part do not need to be included.

Examples of items to include:
- Lesson learned activities to ensure past mistakes are not repeated
- Running data evaluations to help set requirements
- Simulation — FE (modal, static, etc.), CFD, 1D/2D dynamics, thermal, etc.
- Manufacturing trials — printing reviews and trials as needed
- Reviews with suppliers if made out of house
- Printing-specific quality measurements required
- Bench testing — specific tests that can be done off car
- Specific tests to be run on dyno or at track
- Tests needed to ensure durability
- Visualization of the FMU model (include screenshot or render) to provide a user-facing quality check

| Num | Action | Test Description |
| --- | ------ | ---------------- |
| 1   |        |                  |
| 2   |        |                  |
| 3   |        |                  |
| 4   |        |                  |
| 5   |        |                  |

## Specifications
This section specifies physical limits that the component was designed for. This is a way to assign actual limits originally determined necessary in the requirements. It should be very concise and easy to read as a reference for future designs. If the component fails, this will be a handy reference to understand if the part was used outside the limits that it was designed for or if the analysis done made an incorrect assumption.

Consider detailing:
- Component limits
- Complete technical specifications
  - Final mass
  - Temperatures, pressures, load cases, etc.
- Material and component list
- Manufacturing and assembly processes
- Finalized design drawings and 3D models

| Num | Specification |
| --- | ------------- |
| 1   |               |
| 2   |               |
| 3   |               |
| 4   |               |
| 5   |               |

## Preliminary Design Review
- Compliance with design requirements
- Detailed design drawings and models
- Updated calculations and analysis
- Component clearances and interface fits
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Validation plan

## Testing Results
- Test plans and procedures
- Test results and data
- Compliance with design requirements
- Lessons learned and final remarks
- FMU model visualization shared with stakeholders for visual confirmation

## One-Page Calculation Summaries
- Create a dedicated one-page calculation summary document for every iteration of the model.
- Each summary should clearly capture key assumptions, calculation highlights, and resulting decisions.
- Archive every iteration's summary (e.g., versioned filenames or dated folders) so stakeholders can review how the model evolved over time.
- Link or reference each summary document within this section for easy access.

| --------- | -------------------------- | ---- | ----- |
