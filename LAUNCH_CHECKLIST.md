## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If Webhook Fails

```bash
# Check logs
fly logs -a fmu-gateway-long-pine-7571 | grep webhook

# Verify secret is set
fly secrets list -a fmu-gateway-long-pine-7571

# Re-deploy to refresh
fly deploy --remote-only -a fmu-gateway-long-pine-7571
```

### If Payment Token Not Generated

1. Check webhook delivery in Stripe dashboard
2. Verify `checkout.session.completed` event sent
3. Check app logs for webhook processing
4. Verify payment_tokens table in database

### If Simulation Fails

1. Verify FMU exists in library
2. Check authorization header format
3. Verify payment token not expired/consumed
4. Review app logs for error details

## 🎓 What We Learned

### Technical Wins

1. ✅ SQLite fallback enables zero-dependency deployment
2. ✅ Stripe Checkout simplifies payment UX
3. ✅ HTTP 402 protocol perfect for API billing
4. ✅ Comprehensive test suite catches integration issues
5. ✅ Fly.io auto-scaling handles traffic spikes

### Gotchas Resolved

1. ⚠️ Fly.io requires explicit `[[services.ports]]` configuration
2. ⚠️ `.fly.dev` certificates are automatic (don't manually add)
3. ⚠️ Environment variables vs Secrets (use secrets for sensitive data)
4. ⚠️ PowerShell JSON escaping requires `@file` approach
5. ⚠️ Database resets on redeploy (use persistent volume `/data`)
